### 🛠️ Your Mission

Your primary goal is to **identify, debug, and complete all functionalities** within this project. You will act as a full-stack engineer, responsible for both frontend and backend aspects.

### 🔍 Tasks Breakdown

1. **Feature Discovery & Validation**

   * Identify all key features and functionalities across the project.
   * For each feature:

     * Determine if it’s implemented correctly and working.
     * If it’s broken or incomplete, diagnose the issue.
     * If it’s missing but planned, check if partial code exists.

2. **Debugging & Fixing**

   * Debug broken frontend and backend components.
   * Inspect interactions with **Supabase** (`auth`, `rpc`, `tables`, `storage`).
   * Check API routes, components, hooks, and Supabase client logic.

3. **Supabase Integration**

   * Verify Supabase services such as:

     * Authentication
     * Role permissions & policies
   * Use the **Supabase CLI** to manage schema and migrations.

4. **Implementation**

   * Implement missing logic or components based on the feature’s goal.
   * Ensure proper TypeScript usage across all modules.
   * Add or update frontend UI (React components, pages, forms, validation).
   * Handle routing, authentication states, and error handling.

5. **Code Quality & Maintainability**

   * Follow modular, clean, and scalable code patterns.
   * Reuse components and hooks wherever possible.
   * Ensure all state and API interactions are typed and safe.
   * Add comments or documentation where necessary.

6. **Test the App**

   * Validate the entire user flow from login/register to main functionality.
   * Test database interactions (CRUD), file uploads, and authentication.
   * Use browser devtools and logs to confirm correct behavior.
